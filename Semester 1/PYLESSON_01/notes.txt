Python Lesson 1
Programming language is use to communicate only with computer.
In 1980s Guido Van Rossum created a computer language called python.
Every programming language has different ways to translate assembly codes and source codes into machine code.
Language like c use compiled languages to translate source codes into machine codes before it can be run.
Some languages use interpreter languages to translate source codes into machine codes as it is being run.
Python codes is compiled.
Python carries both compiled languages and interpreter language.
Python translate the languages into bytecode, so it can carry some benefit of both languages.
